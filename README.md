# Dust

## Note to future Ivan

The `main` branch is on a stable commit. The `wip` branch is an unfinished spike on new stuff that might be worth reviewing or might just be mulch for the grand composter of time.

## What is Dust?

* A programming environment where you don't think *systemically* — you think *improvisationally*.

## Building

*If you'd like to hack on Dust and aren't sure how to set up these tools, reach out and I'll help you.*

Tools you'll need:
* A "typical" JS dev setup with node/npm
* [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org)
* A SASS compiler — I recommend [Dart SASS](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass)

For CoffeeScript and SASS, you can either install them globally (via [brew](https://brew.sh), etc) or add them to the package.json and install via npm.

When you have all the tools, run `npm install` to grab all the dependencies, and then run `npm start` to compile the project and launch a local server.
